- ordered reduction rules
- `or' in contract domains
- heuristic for finding cycles
- `where-not'
- `fresh' in metafunctions
- specify which reduction rules can participate in non-determinism
- or/and patterns
- syntax-parse style pattern match failure explanations
- automatic totality checker for contracted metafunctions
- LHS generation should respect the domain of the metafunction
- one term `where' clause should be interpreted as
  (where #t term)
- errors inside test cases shouldn't stop the program
  test--> should check that the expected values is in the range of the relation
- sexp -> sexp optional argument to traces to transform terms
  before printing.
