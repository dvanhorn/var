;; An example from Degen, Thiemann, Wehr

;; Aside: there's an interesting interaction between contracts and
;; laziness in this example:
;; the domain contract is strict in *both* its arguments, while
;; the function is only strict in the first.

;; So with in a lazy language, contract monitoring is semantics changing.
